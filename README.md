# Tenon CLI

This CLI was made to interact with the Tenon.io API. It utilizes Node and Commander,js to create a UNIX-style CLI.

### Installation

Tenon CLI requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v4+ to run.

Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.

```sh
$ npm install tenon-cli -g
$ tenon --key=XXXXXXXX --config=config.json https://example.com
```

### Development

To develop this CLI further, modify the following files:

`tenon.js` - This is where the Tenon API is called and where the options included in these calls and used to manage the return data exists.

`index.js` - This is where the actual CommanderJS parser and all of the CLI specific data exists.

*NOTE: ANY CHANGES MADE TO OPTIONS IN `index.js` MUST BE REFLECTED IN `testIndex.js` BECAUSE THEIR ENVIRONMENTS ARE SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT BUT THE TEST FILE MUST ACCURATELY MOCK THE PRODUCTION INDEX FILE IN ORDER FOR TESTING TO BE EFFECTIVE.*

Then run
```sh
$ npm run compile
```

Then when you are ready to run it as a full blown CLI, run this from the root directory of the project:
```sh
$ npm install -g
```

(optional) Third:
```sh
$ karma start
```
#### Testing
Tests automatically utilize babel and ES6 standards, to run tests just enter (from the project root directory):
```
$ npm run test
```
This will run the tests using mocha.

To write new tests, just put them in the `test/` folder and they will automatically be tested with the above command. Each test that utilizes/mocks the CLI arguments and their conversion to options must import/require `testIndex.js`.
